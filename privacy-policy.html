    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 26, 2026</p>

    <p>
      Northline Studio LLC ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed
      to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
      use, and safeguard information when you use our mobile applications and services.
    </p>

    <h2>Anonymous Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>anonymous authentication</strong>, which means we do not collect your
      email address, password, or any personally identifying information to create an account.
      When you first open our app, a random identifier is automatically generated. This
      identifier is used solely to sync your preferences and purchases across your devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Player Nicknames:</strong> Names you enter for players within the app.
        These are stored to personalize your experience and are not verified against
        real identities.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Preferences:</strong> Settings and selections you make within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Support Communications:</strong> If you contact us for support, you provide
        your email address and any information included in your message. We use this only
        to respond to your inquiry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anonymous Identifier:</strong> A randomly generated ID used to recognize your app installation.
        It is not linked to your real-world identity.</li>
      <li><strong>Core App Events:</strong> Minimal operational data needed to provide features (e.g., game sessions,
        content selections) tied only to your anonymous identifier.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase Verification:</strong> Confirmation of one-time, non-consumable purchases used to unlock features.
        Payment processing is handled by Apple; we do not receive your payment details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Stored on Your Device</h3>
    <p>
      We store minimal data locally on your device, including: age verification status,
      your last game settings, and UI preferences (such as whether you've dismissed
      certain prompts). This data never leaves your device unless you choose to sync.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Email addresses or passwords</li>
      <li>Real names or contact information (unless you contact us directly)</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Photos, camera, or microphone access</li>
      <li>Contacts or address book</li>
      <li>Device identifiers beyond our anonymous ID</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We do not display advertisements in our apps. We do not share your data with
      advertising networks or data brokers. We do not sell your information.

      <li>Respond to support requests</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use Firebase Realtime Database (Google Cloud) to store app data associated with your
      anonymous identifier. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use RevenueCat to
      manage purchase verification and restore purchases. We maintain administrative and
      technical safeguards designed to protect your information.
    </p>

    <p>Our apps use the following third-party services:</p>

      <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may process and retain data to comply with
        legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where required by law, we will ask for your consent before

      request restriction of processing in certain circumstances.

    <p>
      <strong>International Transfers:</strong> Your data may be transferred to and processed
      in the United States where our service providers operate. We rely on appropriate safeguards,
