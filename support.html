    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">How do I restore my purchases?</h3>
    <p>
      If you've previously purchased content and need to restore it on a new device,
      look for a "Restore Purchases" button in the app's settings or store section.
      Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">How do I request a refund?</h3>
    <p>
      All purchases are processed through the Apple App Store. To request a refund,
      please visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>
      or contact Apple Support directly.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">How do I delete my account and data?</h3>
    <p>
      You can delete your account and all associated data from within the app's settings.
      Look for "Delete My Data" or a similar option. This action is permanent and cannot
      be undone. Your purchases can still be restored after deletion if you use the same Apple ID.
